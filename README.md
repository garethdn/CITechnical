# Marionette Skeleton

Boilerplate code for Marionette projects using Grunt, Bower, SASS and RequireJS.

### Installation

Run `npm start` to install all dependencies in `package.json`. When complete this will automatically trigger `bower install` and then `grunt build` - finally start an express server. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view th app.

### Why not use a yeoman generator?

* The current version of `generator-backbone` (0.3.2) is [breaking](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone/issues/360).

* There doesn't appear to be a good, regularly updated yeoman generator for a Marionette application.

* I only want the bare essentials for my own applications.
